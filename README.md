# Welcome to my portfolio website

The website is composed of four seperate pages.  
HOME:
The first page is the home page where you will find a few of my projects with a title, image, and description of each.  
The title and image are both clickable links to either the project website or the project github repository. 
Any time you want to revisit the home page, you can click on home in the navbar or the logo at the top with the initials GL.

ABOUT ME: 
This page is a quick summary about personal characteristics and skills that I offer as an employee.

EXPERIENCE: 
This page lists both professional and academic experience with a link to contact me at the bottom. 

CONTACT:
This page has a submission form that starts an email to me from the local machine's defuault mail program. 
A blank email addressed to me will open on a new page when clicked. 
Some other links include my github and linkedin sites where you can learn more about some of my projects.

Everything has been designed mobile-first.  One thing that may not be intuitive is that the navbar has a 
horizontal scroll bar when in mobile screen mode so make sure to click on Contact, which may be off screen 
in mobile mode.
