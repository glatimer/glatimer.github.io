      <p class="about-text">
        I'm Genevieve Latimer, a Computer Science undergraduate at Portland
        State University set to complete my degree in June 2024. I'm passionate
        about front-end, back-end, and full-stack website development,
        proficient in C++/C and Python, and soon to be expanding my skill set to
        include Go or Rust.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I have experience with object-oriented programming, data structures,
        Linux, and Git revision control. I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript and eager to apply my knowledge in a real-world environment.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        My background in customer service and management from the restaurant
        industry has taught me the importance of clear communication,
        collaboration, and attention to detail. I enjoy supporting my fellow
        students and have experience working on group projects using different
        methods of software development.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        As I approach graduation, I'm actively seeking opportunities for
        internships or full-time positions in front-end, back-end, and
        full-stack website development. I'm excited to contribute my skills and
        learn from experienced developers in a professional setting. If you're
        interested in discussing potential opportunities, please don't hesitate
        to reach out.
