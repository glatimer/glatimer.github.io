          MANAGER â€¢ ANCESTRY BREWING <br />
          April 2017 - November 2020
        </p>
        <p class="experience-text">
          As a manager, I fostered a positive work environment for our team of
          servers, dishwashers, and hosts. I excelled in multi-tasking and was
          able to seamlessly transition between tasks, from serving to cleaning
          to managing finances. In a fast-paced environment, I relied on my
          ability to anticipate needs and think on my feet.
        </p>
        <p class="experience-text">
          One of my top priorities was ensuring customer satisfaction. I
          actively listened to customer feedback and used problem-solving skills
          to resolve any issues that arose. My dedication to customer
          satisfaction resulted in repeat business and positive reviews.
