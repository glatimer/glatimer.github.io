        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
          I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Portland
          State University's Maseeh College of Engineering and expect to
          graduate in June of 2024. My strong foundation in programming includes
          proficiency in C++, C, and Python, with a drive to continue learning
          and growing my skillset. To further enrich my education, I'm currently
          studying algorithms, as well as expanding my knowledge of databases,
          networks, security, and full-stack website development before
          graduation. I am passionate about software development and eager to
          apply my skills in a real-world environment.
